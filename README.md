# An modified implementation of Dynamic Memory Networks on SQUAD dataset 

* #### the project is not complete
* #### optimization for cuda-machine is going on
* #### possible modification to sentence level embeddings expected
* #### once optimization is over evaluation is to be carried out
* #### right now only squadv1 is attempted

#### dmn.py contains the model
#### poc.py starts training the model
#### gru_modules.py gives modified gru models mentioned in the paper
#### prep.py does preprocessing of the data
